*issues #1: submitting request in graphiql resets query and variable when result displays*

- ![sample request before submitting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacKentoch/scaphold-contrib-statics/master/print_screens/V2/before-request-submit.png)

 - any query or mutation (with or without variables)



- ![sample request after submitting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacKentoch/scaphold-contrib-statics/master/print_screens/V2/after-request-submit.png)

 - result displays as intended but it resets query
 - history did not register the query (empty history)
